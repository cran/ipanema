Title: Read Data from 'LimeSurvey'
Version: 1.1.0
Authors@R: person("Maximilian", "Hagspiel", role = c("aut", "cre","cph"), email = "maxhag@mailbox.org")
Description: Read data from 'LimeSurvey'
    (<https://www.limesurvey.org/>)
    in a comfortable way.
    Heavily inspired by 'limer'
    (<https://github.com/cloudyr/limer/>),
    which lacked a few comfort features for me.
