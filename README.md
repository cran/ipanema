Read Data from LimeSurvey.

This package allows me to read data from
[LimeSurvey](<https://www.limesurvey.org/>)
in a comfortable way.
Heavily inspired by
[{limer}](<https://github.com/cloudyr/limer/>),
which lacked a few comfort features for me.

## Contact

I'm more than happy to receive any feedback or questions regarding this package:
